# 🔧 GitHub Pages Configuration Fix

## Current Issue
**Problem**: GitHub Pages is serving README.md instead of the React app's index.html  
**Cause**: GitHub Pages source setting is likely misconfigured

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/hector-norza/HectorNorza/settings/pages
2. **Look for "Source" section**
3. **Current setting**: Probably "Deploy from a branch" 
4. **Required setting**: **"GitHub Actions"**

### Step 2: Change Source to GitHub Actions
1. In the "Source" dropdown, select **"GitHub Actions"**
2. Save the changes
3. This will force GitHub to use our custom deployment workflow
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for redeployment

## Why This Fixes The Issue

### ❌ Current (Wrong) Configuration:
- **Source**: "Deploy from a branch" (main branch)
- **GitHub Pages**: Looks for index.html in root directory
- **Finds**: README.md first, serves that instead
- **Result**: Shows README instead of React app

### ✅ Correct Configuration:
- **Source**: "GitHub Actions" 
- **Our Workflow**: Builds React app and uploads `dist/` folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Serves built index.html with proper assets
- **Result**: React app loads with all features

## Verification Steps

### After Changing Settings:
1. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Visit**: https://www.hectornorza.com
3. **Expected**: React app loads with accessibility toolbar
4. **Check Console**: No MIME type errors

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ React app loads (not README)
- ✅ Accessibility toolbar appears in bottom-right
- ✅ Privacy banner shows on first visit  
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ All navigation and features work

## Alternative Verification

### Test Both URLs:
```bash
# Custom domain
curl -s https://www.hectornorza.com | grep -o "assets/index\.[^\"]*\.js"

# GitHub Pages URL  
curl -s https://hector-norza.github.io/HectorNorza/ | grep -o "assets/index\.[^\"]*\.js"

# Both should return: assets/index.[hash].js
```

### Check Build Logs:
1. Go to: https://github.com/hector-norza/HectorNorza/actions
2. Click latest workflow run
3. Verify: "Verify Build Output" step shows proper files
4. Confirm: No errors in deployment

## If Issue Persists

### Additional Steps:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try Incognito Mode**: Bypass all caching
3. **Check DNS**: Ensure custom domain points correctly
4. **Wait for CDN**: GitHub Pages CDN may take 10-15 minutes

### Manual Trigger:
1. Go to: https://github.com/hector-norza/HectorNorza/actions
2. Click "Deploy React App to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow" > "Run workflow"
4. Force a fresh deployment

**🎯 Once you change the source to "GitHub Actions", your site should load the React app instead of the README!**

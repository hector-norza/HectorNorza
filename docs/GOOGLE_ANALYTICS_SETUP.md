# Google Analytics Setup Guide

## ✅ SETUP COMPLETE

Google Analytics 4 is now properly configured and running on your portfolio website!

### Current Configuration
- **Measurement ID**: `G-VPC78XB0H1`
- **Implementation**: HTML script tags in `index.html` (recommended approach)
- **Event Tracking**: Available via `analytics.ts` utility functions

### How It Works
1. **HTML Integration**: Google Analytics is loaded directly in the HTML head section for optimal performance
2. **Event Tracking**: React components can use utility functions to track user interactions
3. **Privacy-Friendly**: Only tracks page views and user-initiated actions

### What Gets Tracked
- ✅ Page views and navigation
- ✅ Contact form submissions  
- ✅ External link clicks (GitHub, LinkedIn)
- ✅ Basic user engagement metrics

### Files Involved
- `/index.html` - Contains GA initialization script
- `/src/utils/analytics.ts` - Event tracking utilities
- `/src/components/Contact.tsx` - Uses form submission tracking

### Verify Analytics is Working
1. Visit [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Go to your property: "Hector Norzagaray Portfolio"
3. Check "Reports" > "Realtime" to see live visitors
4. Visit your website at https://www.hectornorza.com
5. You should see your visit appear in the realtime report within 30 seconds

## Privacy Considerations

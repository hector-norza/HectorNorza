# My First Blog Post 🌟

Hello and welcome! I'm Hector Norzagaray, a product manager fueled by a passion for forging meaningful human connections through technology. This blog is my platform to explore the dynamic intersection of product development, technology, and community engagement. I'm thrilled to share my insights, lessons learned, and occasional breakthroughs with you! 🚀

## My Journey: From Community Building to Product Management 🌍

My path to tech wasn't a straight line. Before becoming a product manager, I was deeply immersed in community building—nurturing grassroots initiatives, fostering collaboration, and amplifying collective voices. Those experiences revealed technology's transformative power: when thoughtfully designed, it unites people and strengthens communities; when poorly executed, it risks creating division. This realization became my north star, guiding me to product management, where I could shape digital tools that empower and connect. ✨

As a product manager, my community-building roots have been supercharged. For example, while working on developer tools at Microsoft Azure, I led initiatives to incorporate user feedback from diverse developer communities, ensuring our products addressed real-world needs and fostered collaboration across global teams. Leading cross-functional teams, conducting user research, and crafting product strategies have amplified my ability to scale community engagement, transforming local insights into global solutions. 🌐

## My Product Philosophy: Community at the Core 🤝

As a product manager, I champion a *community-first* approach. Every feature, strategy, and roadmap I develop prioritizes the human connections that technology can foster. My methodology blends strategic vision, empathetic user focus, and transparent collaboration to align diverse teams—engineers, designers, marketers—toward a shared goal: building products that strengthen communities. 💡

Whether I'm diving into user research to uncover community needs, defining a product vision that inspires collective action, or guiding teams to bring ideas to life, my mission remains clear: create digital pathways that connect people, bridge perspectives, and empower communities to thrive.

## Guiding Questions ❓

My work is driven by questions like:

- How can this product authentically uplift and unite its users? 😊
- How do we design inclusive solutions that foster trust and spark meaningful engagement? 🤗
- What barriers can we remove to make technology a true enabler for all communities? 🛠️

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

In today's digital landscape, having a personal online presence is more than a nice-to-have — it's a way to shape your story, build your voice, and contribute meaningfully to your field.

As a product manager focused on community, I wanted to create a place where I could:

## 💡 My Product Philosophy

My journey into tech didn’t begin with a business plan — it began with people.

For years, I’ve been involved in organizing, growing, and supporting grassroots communities. Through that work, I saw firsthand how tools can either isolate or empower — and I knew I wanted to help build the kind that empowers.

As a PM, I bring a **community-first mindset** to everything I work on. I’m driven by questions like:
- *How will this feature empower the people using it?*
- *How can we design for inclusion, trust, and real connection?*
- *How do we bridge gaps between people, ideas, and outcomes?*

My work blends **strategic thinking, user empathy, and strong communication** to align teams and deliver thoughtful, human-centered solutions.
